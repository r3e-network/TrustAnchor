TrustAnchor smart contracts

## notice

TrustAnchor is derived from an earlier NEO3-era contract design.

The compiler and toolkits at that time were not developed well and were not compatible with the latest version.

If you want to know how the contract code is compiled, view [Github Workflow YML file](.github/workflows/dotnet.yml).

Due to the limitations of the toolkits at that time, this code used some tricky skills, so it is **NOT** recommended that the new version of the compiler restore its compatibility.

In order to keep consistency with the running smart contract code on the mainnet, the code will not be switched to the new version of the compiler for the time being.
